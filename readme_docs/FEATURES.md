### Activity Audit
Activity auditing captures all requests made to a particular API endpoint and writes a record with metadata to the database. The metadata that is collected would include the authenticated user, requestor's IP Address, current date and time, request URL, request body (if POST, PUT, PATCH), and any other pertinent information the developer has accessible and determines should be in the activity audit log. 

** Talk about response status code and result. How is this logged?
