## APIDoc - Document A Web Service
Web service documentation for consumers is facilitated through the use of a framework called [apiDoc](http://apidocjs.com). apiDoc provides a set of annotation that are placed in a comment block within the web service controller class. To generate the documentation website for consumers, apiDoc provides a Node script that scans the source files for apiDoc annotations to create a pretty HTML website. 

The complete documenation of apiDoc can be found on their website [http://apidocjs.com](http://apidocjs.com/).

### Example
Below is an example of the comments used to document an endpoint.

```
         /**
         * @api {get} /v2/widget/:id Get a widget
         * @apiVersion 0.2.0
         * @apiName GetWidget
         * @apiGroup Widget
         *
         * @apiParam {Number} id widget's unique ID.
         *
         * @apiSuccess {String} name Name of the widget.
         * @apiSuccess {Number} id ID of the widget.
         * @apiSuccess {String} color Color of the widget
         * 
         * @apiSuccessExample Success-Response:
         *     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         *     {
         *        "id": 3,
         *        "name": "Large Widget"
         *        "color": "Green"
         *     }
         *
         * @apiUse NotFoundError
         */
        [Route("widget/{id:int}")]
        public IHttpActionResult Get(int id)
        ...
```

### Reusable apiDoc blocks
apiDoc supports creating reusuable documentation blocks using [@apiDefine](http://apidocjs.com/#param-api-define). This 
cuts down on repeated comment blocks for shared elements such as errors. 
All reusable blocks should be placed in  ***Launchpad.Web\Controllers\_apidoc.js***

### Current @apiDefine blocks
1. BadRequestError
   - Used when an endpoint can return a 400
2.  NotFoundError
    - Used when an endpoint can return a 404

### Generating documentation
To generate the api docs after a change:

1. In ***Launchpad.Web*** execute npm run doc
   - This is an npm script that is defined in package.json
   - Script: apidoc -o docs -i .\\ -f \".cs$\" -f \"_apidoc.js\"
   - This will scan the Controllers folder for endpoints and place the output in \docs

To view the documentation either run the application and navigate to /docs/ or open the static index.html file.

## API Versioning
API versioning is handled through URL versioning. See the [Web Service Pattern for API Versioning](WEB-SERVICE-PATTERNS.md#versioning). 

Each version of the an api will have a new controller source file and a unique url that contains the version. The routing for these versions is handled via attributes. The steps for creating a new version of an API are roughly as follows:

1. If a subfolder does not exist for a version, create it 
   - \v1, \v2, \v3...
2. Add a route prefix to the static RoutePrefixes class
3. Create the a new controller
4. Add the RoutePrefix attribute at the class level
5. Add the Route attribute to each operation, specifying the route template
