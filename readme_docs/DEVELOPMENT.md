## Core Values
These are the core standards that our development team agrees to follow. All of our decisions should be tested against our core values. Only a team decision can overrule our core values on a case-by-case basis. 

1. __Always act in the best interest of our customer's time, money, and desired quality__
  * We succeed when our customer is amazed at our ability to deliver on-time, within budget, and with the highest possible quality given the time and money constraints. 
  * Test every decision with the question "Does this align with the customer's budget, timeline, and quality expectations?"
2. __Be respectful always (aka Golden Rule)__
  * Teams that respect each other with their words and actions achieve high throughput consistently
  * When we talk down to each other we are deciding that WE are more important than the customer!
3. __No Lone Ranger Developers__
  * Acting on your own excludes your team from decision making, which is a form of disrespect
  * Perfect code is a product of team collaboration and communication
4. __Peer code reviews are required__
  * For every 10 liines of code written, ~ 1 bug is introduced into the code base. 
  * Peer reviewed code has been found to significantly reduce bugs and missed requirements
  * Be thorough and respectful!
5. __Build for today's needs, not what might be needed tomorrow__
  * Make the best choices based on the customer's concrete needs today!
  * Building for the future is subjective guesswork that rarely meets unknowable customer needs

## Code Branching
The following code branching strategy is meant to ensure the following objectives: 
* Encourage the benefits of frequent commits/pushes to the Git repo
* Isolate work-in-progress from other developers
* Tag branches with meaningful names to identify features
* Only promote peer reviewed code into the "master" branch
  
> __All Branches Work The Same Way__ There are many strategies that may be employed when branching. Regardless of the branching strategies that are used, it's helpful to know that technically branches all function the same way. Terms like "long running branches" or "topic branches" simply refer to a strategy for how to use the branching feature of Git.
  
### Long Running Branch: Master
A project can support multiple "long running" branches that are always open and ready for new code. It's typical to have a long running branch called "master" that holds stable code that is currently in production and code soon to be deployed to production. It's not uncommon for development teams to have a long running branch called "develop" that contains less stable code that needs to be tested and verified before being pushed to the more stable "master" branch. 

The current development practice for this team is to only support a "master" long running branch that will hold all code currently in production and new code that has been peer code reviewed. 

### Topic Branches
Topic branches are shorter lived branches are often times referred to as "feature branches". Topic branches can be thought of as workspaces for developers to make their code changes for a single (hopefully small) feature. 
```
 --------- MASTER ---------------------------------------> Production
    \-- Topic #123 --/     \---- Topic #124 ----/
```

Topic Branch Workflow

1. Create a new branch from a long running branch like "master"
  * Name the Topic branch with the ticket number from your task management app + short english description (ie LP-1234 Navbar Quick Search)
  * Creating a good name allows for quick comparison of the task management app and Git for what's in the release and what's not
3. Make code changes
  * Commit to the local Git repo as often as necessary using descriptive commit messages
  * Write meaningful commit messages as these will often be read by peer developers
4. Push code changes
  * Push to the Topic branch in the Git repo as often as necessary so that changes wont be lost if your computer blows up
5. [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
  * Create a pull request (if available in your Git repo) and ask 1-2 developers to review the code online
  * GitHub and BitBucket both have great diff tools for doing code reviews on-demand and providing comments. 
6. Peer Reviewer Merge
  * Once the peer reviewer has signed-off on the changes, then ONLY THE PEER REVIEWER can merge the changes into the long running branch "master"
  * The developer's name on the merge is the official stamp of approval and statement that the code reviewer takes responsibility for the quality of the code. 
7. Delete Topic Branch
  * Topic branches that have been merged into "master" should be deleted immediately as they are no longer necessary
  * Work with the team to determine if a different time interval is needed for retaining old branches and update this document
  
### Other Strategies
This guide is focusing on the simplest branching strategies so that even the least experienced person on the team (at least with Git) can quickly get familiar with the workflow. Starting with a complext branching strategy can be a frustrating experience that can cause confusion in a team. If your team is an advanced group ready for the next level of Git, then consider updating this section with you preferred Git workflow strategies and training your team so as to avoid confusion and mistakes. 

Read [Git - Branching Workflows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) for more information.

## Code Review & Merge
Peer code reviews are perhaps the _most_ important team development step in a project. Code reviews are an opportunity for team members to catch oversights in code, bugs, standards, and best practices. Code reviews are also opportunities for developers to teach each other about our documented standards and guidelines as well as to share other general development knowledge and best practices from experience. Further more, code reviews encourage developers to share work-in-progress frequently and to develop respectful and trusting relationships (ie team building). 

Once a thorough code review has been completed, the peer reviewer will perform the merge process to the long running branch (i.e. master), which will stamp the reviewers name on the merge to show the code was reviewed and approved. 

__Rules__
* It is _your_ responsibility to have your code reviewed in a timely manner
* It is _never_ acceptable to have your code merged into a long running branch without a code review
* Merging code into a long running branch can only be performed by the peer code reviewer
* You are required to fix any violations of the __documented__ team dev standards/guidelines
* Peer reviewer recommendations that are not supported by documented team dev standards/guidelines are optional
* Seek to have your code reviewed by someone more experienced so that you can learn something new!
* Change up who reviews your code to promote cross training and to learn from new people
* Make time to provide a thoughtful code review. 
* Be kind and follow the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

## Current Tech Stack

TODO: Each of these should be their own document (if necessary)

- Autofac
- EntityFramework
- Asp.Net Identity
- Asp.Net MVC
- Asp.Net Web Api 2
- Owin Middleware for Bearer Security
- Serilog  

## Development Tools
The following tools should be installed on the development machine:

1. Visual Studio 2015
2. SQL Server 
   - Checked in connection strings point at SQLExpress 
   - Default instance: localhost\sqlexpress
3. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. [apiDocJs](http://apidocjs.com/)
   - npm install -g apidoc 

## Build
After pulling the source code install the required packages: 

1. Pull the source code from github repo
2. Perform a Nuget package restore
3. Perform a npm install in folder ***Launchpad.Web***

## Database
The application uses a SQL Database and Code First Migrations. This migration strategy will be replaced with a TBD tool.

1. In Visual Studio, open the package manager console
2. Set the Default project to ***Launchpad.Data***
3. Run Update-Database from the console to create the database
   - The connection string in ***Launchpad.Web*** web.config determines where the database will be created
   - The default is localhost/sqlexpress with initial catalog Launchpad
   - When the web.config connection string is changed, update the connection string in ***Launchpad.Data.IntegrationTests***

### Users
A default user will be seeded into the database when Update-Database is run. The user is *admin@admin.com* / *Hello123!* - new users can be created using the Register link. 

Each new user will be created with a 'Basic' role whcih allows them to log in. You may notice on the dashboard a 403 (Forbidden) is generated. The basic role does not have the 'list.widgets' claim. To resolve this and see the widgets, login as the admin and select Add Claim. Choose 'Basic' as the role and enter 'lss.permission' and 'list.widgets' for the claim type and claim value respectively. 

## Dependency Injection
The application is using Autofac as the DI container. Each project contains a module file that is responsible for registering the contained
components with the container. The overall container is setup in the ContainerConfig in ***Launchpad.Web***.

The lifetime for the majority of components should be per request to keep request scopes isolated. Autofac will handle diposing the resolved
values the end of the request. For more: [http://docs.autofac.org/en/latest/lifetime/disposal.html](http://docs.autofac.org/en/latest/lifetime/disposal.html)

Autofac supports assembly scanning. This allows the registration of all components that implement a particular interface. For example the repositories
are registered using scanning. This can simplify the container configuration through the automatic registration via convention. (All repositories implement IRepository, ect.)

```
  builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(ThisAssembly)
                .AssignableTo<IStatusMonitor>()
                .AsImplementedInterfaces()
                .InstancePerRequest();
```

## Logging
Logging has been configured to use [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) with a SQL Server sink. It is registered as a singleton. 

This is a structure logging library which allows additional
functionality when searching for events. For more information see the website. 

### Usage
To utilize logging, add it as a constructor dependency and the container will resolve it.
````
public StatusV2Controller(IStatusCollector statusCollector, ILogger log)
{
  _statusCollector = statusCollector.ThrowIfNull(nameof(statusCollector));
  _log = log.ThrowIfNull(nameof(log));
}
````

````
[Route("status/{id:int}")]
public IHttpActionResult Get(MonitorType id)
{
  _log.Information("Request for MonitorType -> {id}", id);
  return Ok(_statusCollector.Collect(id));
}
```
### Debugging
Serilog will fail silently if there is an issue logging a message. While this is desirable in production, when debugging it can be hard identify the issue with the message template. Serilog offers debugging out to help troubleshoot issues. To turn on the output, use:

```
 Serilog.Debugging.SelfLog.Enable(msg => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(msg));
```
 
 
This will write Serilog issues to the output window. For more options see the [documentation](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Debugging-and-Diagnostics).

## API Versioning
API versioning is handled through URL versioning. See the [Web Service Pattern for API Versioning](WEB-SERVICE-PATTERNS.md#versioning). 

Each version of the an api will have a new controller source file and a unique url that contains the version. The routing for these versions is handled via attributes. The steps for creating a new version of an API are roughly as follows:

1. If a subfolder does not exist for a version, create it 
   - \v1, \v2, \v3...
2. Add a route prefix to the static RoutePrefixes class
3. Create the a new controller
4. Add the RoutePrefix attribute at the class level
5. Add the Route attribute to each operation, specifying the route template

## API Doc
The web api controllers are using inline documentation called apiDoc. The documentation is embedded as comments above each controller method. For 
more details see the [documentation](http://apidocjs.com/).

### Sample Documentation Comments
Below is an example of the comments used to document an endpoint.

```
         /**
         * @api {get} /v2/widget/:id Get a widget
         * @apiVersion 0.2.0
         * @apiName GetWidget
         * @apiGroup Widget
         *
         * @apiParam {Number} id widget's unique ID.
         *
         * @apiSuccess {String} name Name of the widget.
         * @apiSuccess {Number} id ID of the widget.
         * @apiSuccess {String} color Color of the widget
         * 
         * @apiSuccessExample Success-Response:
         *     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         *     {
         *        "id": 3,
         *        "name": "Large Widget"
         *        "color": "Green"
         *     }
         *
         * @apiUse NotFoundError
         */
        [Route("widget/{id:int}")]
        public IHttpActionResult Get(int id)
        ...
```

### Reusable apiDoc blocks
apiDoc supports creating reusuable documentation blocks using [@apiDefine](http://apidocjs.com/#param-api-define). This 
cuts down on repeated comment blocks for shared elements such as errors. 
All reusable blocks should be placed in  ***Launchpad.Web\Controllers\_apidoc.js***

### Current @apiDefine blocks

1. BadRequestError
   - Used when an endpoint can return a 400
2.  NotFoundError
    - Used when an endpoint can return a 404

### Generating documentation
To generate the api docs after a change:
1. In ***Launchpad.Web*** execute npm run doc
   - This is an npm script that is defined in package.json
   - Script: apidoc -o docs -i .\\ -f \".cs$\" -f \"_apidoc.js\"
   - This will scan the Controllers folder for endpoints and place the output in \docs

To view the documentation either run the application and navigate to /docs/ or open the static index.html file.
