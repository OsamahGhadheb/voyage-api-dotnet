## Overview
Launchpad Web Services API provides a foundational set of web services that implement industry standard guidelines, common best practices, and the experienced insights afforded to Lighthouse Software thru decades of enterprise business software development. 

If you are extending this API to build a new app, then replace this section with a detailed overview of the new app. Include as much or as little detail as necessary to convey to the developers what this project is about. Often times less is more.
